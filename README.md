## About

This is a Pytorch implementation of **JGRM** as described in the paper [More Than Routing: Joint GPS and Route Modeling for Refine Trajectory Representation Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645644).

## Requirement
We build this project by Python 3.7.12 with the following packages:
```
torch==1.7.1
torch-geometric==2.3.1
scikit-learn==1.0.2
pandas==1.3.5
shapely==2.0.1
faiss-cpu==1.7.4
```

## Dataset
You can access our data [here](https://pan.quark.cn/s/25da092b0b64).
The folder contains a total of two datasets, Chengdu and Xi'an. Each folder contains 7 files with the following file directory:
```
|----Chengdu\
|    |----chengdu_1101_1115_data_sample10w.pkl      # Training data
|    |----chengdu_1101_1115_data_seq_evaluation.pkl # Evaluation data
|    |----transition_prob_mat.npy                   # The transition matrix is obtained from the full dataset, a choice for initializing the road network
|    |----init_w2v_road_emb.pt                      # The section embedding is obtained from the word2vec
|    |----edge_geometry.csv                         # Topology of the road section
|    |----edge_features.csv                         # Attributes of the road section
|    |----line_graph_edge_idx.npy                   # Adjacency matrix
